To create a deep learning model, many images must be available of people wearing masks and not wearing mask. 
The images must include people wearing sunglasses, helmets, faces shields or anything that would resemble 
something close to wearing a mask.  From Kaggle, a dataset was available called Face Mask Detection.  The model
that was created from this dataset used environments with TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and more.
